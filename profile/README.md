# CG Programming Club
We are an extracurricular club designed to teach the basics of C++ and provide application for the language, as well as develop teambuilding and more soft skills in the development field.
## What do we do?
- Develop and archive lesson plans to teach each week
- Provide projects for the club members to work on for application-driven experience
- Have fun with each project being an open-ended structure and less like an assignment
